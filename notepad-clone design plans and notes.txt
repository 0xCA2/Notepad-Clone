Things I need to learn before I do this
- How to work with Menu Bars

Challanges
- How to import files into the program and dispkay them on the screen as
  dynamic text (for the OPEN functionality)
- How to export text form the screen into a file the same way it was on the screen
  (for the Save fonctionality)
- How to handle changing of fonts
- GUI stuff generally
- Undo
- Copy and pasting
-  Word Wrap

//  getting an idea
// use Actions
// Create class for that
// Create each option on the menu to have that Action
// put names of ptions in an array somewhere and then use
// each name as the action command as well
// In that action's actionPerformed method is where y ou do the actionCommand
   validation
// Note that Keyboard shortcuts can be done automatically via Accelerators 

// Lets just come up with basic algorithms for how do the the functionalities

// Note, each of these have to have the title of the folder box say what they do


/*Finished the file tab */

- Note, needs to have a scrollbar

--- How is this shit going to be structured?
- GUI Stuff
  - Menu Bar
- Stuff that happens when you click stuff
   - Stuff Dealing with loading and saving files
   - Stuff dealing with editing the content of the file, using the
     content of the file somehow
   - Format
     - Font changes the size, font, italicize, etc of everything in the entire file
     - Word wrap makes it so no lines extend the view of the window (horizontally)
        - So after you use word wrap, the horizontal bar is gone. 
        - Stuff that goes out of the alotted columns for the size of the window 
          automatically goes into the next line 
        - When word wrap is on, the TextArea has be checked repeatedly, so that it can adjust
          text based on whether something is passed the amount of columsn on the screen.  
        - Actually, in notepad when you turn word wrap off it just reloads the entire document
          after having been wordwrapped
        - If you turn wordwrap off it does the opposite. 
        ----- Actual Algorithm-------
        - Find out how much columsn should are in a line based on the size of thw window
        - Test to see if the characters inthe line (including spaces) passes that
        - if it does, drop the last character word below the line
    - View 
      - Allows you to toggle the status bar on and off 
      - Status bar just shows what line you're in and what column you're in, should be
        simple

- Remember, you have to show a popup menu upon right click ,too. 
- Remeber, you have to make things unclickable/usable under certain conditoins too
  - i.e can't use CCPD unless something is selected.
Edit Tab
- Already did undo and redo 
- Now I need to to:
  - cut, copy, paste, delete
  - find, find next, replace, go to 
  - select all, time/date
